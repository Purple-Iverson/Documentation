# **Description**

The scenarios view, also known as use-case view, will show the interaction between the user and the question bank system. In the question bank management system, a user will be able to, log-in to the system, create new different type of questions, view questions stored in the question bank and review (rate) questions when viewing the questions by clicking on a like/dislike icon, export selected questions from the question bank to a zip file and as well tag questions. The administrator will control access to the system, by controlling who is and who is not allowed to log-in into the system by the user's username and password. The database is where all the questions that are being created and imported are stored. When users are creating questions, a corresponding answer to the question will be provided by the user that is creating the question.
