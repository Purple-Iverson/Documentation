# Description of Development View

This diagram describes the components used to make the systems functionality. The login component is an interface that will validate the userâ€™s credentials and allow the user to login if successful. If the user has not registered to user the QBMS, an interface is provided to register the user. Once login the user will be provided with an interface with the option of creating a question to add to the question bank, provide feedback via a like/dislike system and simultaneously view the questions or logout. The create question option has an interface that will allow the user to either import a QTI file or manually enter a question. The view questions and feedback option will provide an interface for the user to like/dislike a question and view questions. The logout option will navigate the user back to the login page.
