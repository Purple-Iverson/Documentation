Hi everybody,

I hope your projects are going well. I would like to clarify the information in the rubric for sprint 3, so that you all are fully aware of what is required for your sprint marking on Monday.
• You will need to show proof of all five of the scrum meetings. If you have not yet had your sprint planning for the final sprint, you will need to show proof that you have organised a meeting with your client.
• All user stories for the sprint should be present in your requirements specification (e.g. taiga) in the correct format, broken into tasks. Each user story should be accompanied by a user acceptance test in the correct format. You should also have a backlog of user stories/requirements.
• Each of the five viewpoints in the 4+1 model should have a corresponding UML diagram. These diagrams will be marked for their format and for how well they describe your project's architecture. To ensure your architecture is adequately described, you may want to have multiple diagrams for a single viewpoint (for example, multiple activity diagrams to show different processes).
• You will need to have completed at least four user stories.
• Codecov/coveralls/etc. should be set up with your github repo. You will need to show that you have written unit tests for your code base and, for full marks, your coverage should be above 50%. Code regarding user interface or database operations can be ignored by the coverage tool.
