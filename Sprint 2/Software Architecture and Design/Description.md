# Software Architecture and Design Description

In creating the software system, flutter will be used as the framework which uses dart language. Flutter has fast rendering. It has one UI design and using a single code base has one user interface and can be used one both platforms which saves development time. 

GitHub will be used as the software configuration management software. The Kanboard on GitHub will be used as our scrum task board which shows our product backlog and the tasks and features to be completed.

For the global architecture, we will be the Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture style. Representational State Transfer standardizes web systems. The question bank management software system will be a web-based software system. 

For the flutter architecture, we will use a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture style, where the model manages the data and system logic, the view will present the model to the user and the controller accepts the user input and passes it to the model. In the model-view-controller architecture style, the components are separate and interact only through specific interfaces. So, the MVC style has low cohesion and allows the interface between data and the business logic and the user interface to communicate seamlessly. The MVC style is as well easy to modify. 

A design pattern method to be used for the QTI files will be the, Template Method. The template method pattern allows for an algorithm skeleton to be defined 
in a superclass as a series of high-level steps, with the implementation of 
these steps defined in subclasses
