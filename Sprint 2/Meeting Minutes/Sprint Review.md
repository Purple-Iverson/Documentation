# Agenda 

* Explanantion to Prof. Klein on Question Bank System
* Prof. Klein created course on moodle where we can test the exports
* All imports are of form QTI (so if in CSV, convert to QTI) - question from Derrin, can be a lot of complexity
* Database Structure - do not store file in a blob in database, store in a file system. 
* Storing in QTI format itself - depends on how you want to query questions 
* Relook at using NoSQL, creating recreational database
* NoSQL database vs MySQL database
* Reasons why we initially chose NoSQL
* Storing image on Lamp Servers
* Having single database is an optimal solution (one central database with related tables)
* Firestore with firebase with noSQL
* mySQL with local server
* Display of WebApp so far
* Get Minimal Viable Product working as quick as possibly and think of everything else as extra features - Prof. Klein
