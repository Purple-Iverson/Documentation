# User Stories Whole Project 

* As a logged out user of the system, I want to be directed to a hub/menu upon login to be present with options to create or import questions, or view questions already stored in the system.
* As an user, I want to create new questions to add to the question bank so that they can be stored and then accessed by other users.
*	As an user, I want to create different types of questions (MCQs, essay, etc.) to add variety and complexity to the tests.
*	As an user, I want to view/access questions in the question bank to create quizzes.
*	As an user, I want to create quizzes directly in the question bank management system to avoid using external applications to create questions.
*	As an user, I want to download/export questions from the question bank, in a zip file adhering the QTI format, to various other LMS platforms so that I can create exams and quizzes.
*	As an user, I want to import questions of various formats (QTIs, CVSs, docx, etc.) from other LMSs, into the question management system to avoid having to recreate questions that already exist.
*	As an user, I want to attach tags to questions so users can easily find questions by subject/topic type in the Question Bank later.
*	As an user, I want to peer review questions on the system to ensure that the questions on the system are of high quality/standard.
*	As an user, I want to track my activity (sessions) on the system to monitor my interaction with the system.
*	As an administrator, I want to manage (grant/deny) access to the system to ensure that no unauthorised users gain access to the question bank.
